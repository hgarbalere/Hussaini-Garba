(i) To solve this problem,we can use HAVING and GROUP BY, and then connect Tenants with INNER JOIN.
SELECT TenantName from Tenants INNER JOIN

        (SELECT TenantID FROM AptTenantsID
         HAVING count(*)>1)C ON Tenants.TenantID=C.TenantID

(ii) This question directly connects Request and Apartments to list the building ID and obtain 
the number of open applications.

         SELECT BUILDINGName, ISNULL (Count,0) as 'count'
         FROM Buildings.
         LEFT JOIN

         (SELECT Apartments. BuildingID, count (*) as 'count'
      
         FROM request INNER JOIN Apartments
         ON Requests.AptID=Apartments.AptID WHERE Requests.Status='open'

         GROUP BY Apartments.BuildingID)
         Reqcounts
         ON
         Reqcounts.BuildingID=Buildings.BuildingID.
